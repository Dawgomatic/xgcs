[0;33mOne of your dependencies, babel-preset-react-app, is importing the

babel-preset-react-app is part of the create-react-app project, [1mwhich

ever be fixed. Add "@babel/plugin-proposal-private-property-in-object" to
your devDependencies to work around this error. This will make this message
go away.[0m
