# XGCS Implementation Status

## Overview
XGCS is being developed as a modern, web-based replacement for QGroundControl with enhanced scalability and modularity. This document tracks the implementation progress.

## Architecture
- **Frontend**: React-based web application
- **Backend**: Hybrid Node.js/Express + C++ MAVSDK
- **Protocol**: MAVLink 2.0 via MAVSDK C++ library
- **Deployment**: Docker-based with support for both local and cloud deployment

## Current Implementation Status

### âœ… Completed Features

#### 1. Docker-Based SITL Simulation
- Full ArduPilot SITL integration with Docker
- Automatic port assignment for multiple simulations
- Persistent simulation state across restarts
- Web-based simulation management UI

#### 2. Basic Vehicle Connections
- Connection management UI
- Support for TCP/UDP connections
- Integration with C++ MAVSDK backend (partial)
- Mock telemetry for testing

#### 3. Infrastructure
- Docker Compose setup for easy deployment
- C++ backend with MAVSDK integration
- Node.js middleware layer
- WebSocket support for real-time data

### ðŸš§ In Progress

#### 1. MAVSDK Integration
- C++ backend exists but needs API endpoints
- Connection manager implemented but not fully exposed
- Telemetry streaming partially implemented

#### 2. Mission Management
- MissionService created with QGC-compatible features
- Routes established for mission upload/download
- Needs C++ backend implementation

### ðŸ“‹ TODO - High Priority

#### 1. Complete MAVSDK Backend API
```cpp
// Need to implement in main.cpp:
- POST /api/add_vehicle
- DELETE /api/remove_vehicle/{id}
- GET /api/vehicle_connected/{id}
- GET /api/telemetry/{id}
- POST /api/mission/upload/{id}
- GET /api/mission/download/{id}
- POST /api/mission/start/{id}
```

#### 2. Real Vehicle Telemetry
- Complete WebSocket bridge for telemetry streaming
- Implement telemetry decimation for performance
- Add telemetry recording/playback

#### 3. Frontend Components
- Primary Flight Display (PFD)
- Mission Planning Map
- Parameter Editor
- Vehicle Status Dashboard

### ðŸ“Š Feature Parity with QGroundControl

| Vehicle Connections | âœ… | ðŸŸ¡ | Basic implementation |
| SITL Support | âœ… | âœ… | Full Docker integration |
| Mission Planning | âœ… | ðŸŸ¡ | Service created, needs UI |
| Telemetry Display | âœ… | ðŸ”´ | Mock data only |
| Parameter Management | âœ… | ðŸ”´ | Not started |
| Log Analysis | âœ… | ðŸ”´ | Not started |
| Video Streaming | âœ… | ðŸ”´ | Not started |
| Multi-Vehicle | âœ… | ðŸŸ¡ | Architecture supports it |
| Firmware Updates | âœ… | ðŸ”´ | Not started |
| RC Calibration | âœ… | ðŸ”´ | Not started |

Legend: âœ… Complete | ðŸŸ¡ Partial | ðŸ”´ Not Started

## Next Steps

### Immediate (This Week)
1. Complete C++ backend API endpoints
2. Test real vehicle connections with MAVSDK
3. Implement telemetry WebSocket streaming
4. Create basic flight instruments UI

### Short Term (Next 2 Weeks)
1. Build mission planning UI
2. Add parameter read/write functionality
3. Implement flight mode control
4. Create vehicle dashboard

### Medium Term (Month 1)
1. Video streaming integration
2. Joystick/gamepad support
3. Multi-vehicle management
4. Log file analysis

## Technical Debt
1. Need comprehensive error handling in connection manager
2. Add unit tests for mission validation
3. Implement proper MAVLink message filtering
4. Add connection retry logic

## Notes
- The hybrid Node.js + C++ approach allows gradual migration
- MAVSDK provides robust MAVLink handling
- Docker deployment ensures consistency across platforms
- WebSocket bridge enables real-time updates in the browser
